# Bypass Webshell Script

## Overview

This script is designed to bypass security mechanisms on servers, allowing webshells to remain undetected by firewalls and security tools that typically identify and remove them. Whether the server has strict firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, or even manual checks, this script helps keep the webshell intact, avoiding server-side deletion or interference.

By leveraging specific bypass techniques, the script can hide the presence of the webshell, ensuring persistent access to the server. This is particularly useful for penetration testers and security professionals who need to maintain access to systems for auditing and testing purposes.

## Key Features

- **Firewall Bypass**: The script is capable of bypassing advanced firewall rules that would typically block or remove webshells.
- **Stealth Mode**: By avoiding patterns and behaviors that typical security tools detect, the script hides the webshell from most security scans and logs.
- **Persistence**: Ensures that the webshell remains active and undetected, even after the server restarts or runs scheduled scans.
- **Server Compatibility**: Works on various server environments, including Apache, NGINX, and other popular web servers, ensuring wide compatibility.
- **Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight and optimized to minimize its digital footprint, reducing the chance of detection through resource monitoring.

## How It Works

1. **Download and Execute**: The script fetches the webshell from a remote source and executes it using PHP's `eval()` function. 
2. **Bypass Security Mechanisms**: It applies a variety of techniques to bypass firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and automated security scans.
3. **Maintain Persistence**: The script actively prevents the server from recognizing the webshell as a threat, keeping it functional over long periods.
